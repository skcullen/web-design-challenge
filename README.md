# web-design-challenge

In this project, we were asked to take data and 4 images of charts that were given (found in Resources and assets folders) and create a website with seven different pages which you can go between using interactions with the nav bar or the visualizations themselves. 

The seven pages included a home/landing page that detailed the project and included a sidebar of visualizations you could interact with. There was a page for each of the 4 given images, which has some observation about that particular image as well as a sidebar to look at the other available images. One page had all 4 images in a larger format for comparisons, and the last page was a table of the data that was used to make the visuals, which required that you turn the table into and html through pandas (process in the Resources folder). I copy and pasted the cities.html(from pandas) into the data.html because it allowed me more flexibilty in formating the table.

Each page included a nav bar from which you were able to access all available pages.

I decided to add one of the Bootswatch themes to make it look more professional.

The only issue was that I cant seem to get it to come up on GitPages. I am not sure why. I have tried to take out all unnecessary files, and renamed the landing.html to index.html, but it just will not come up, but i put the link to it anyway.
